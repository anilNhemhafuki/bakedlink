Transform the existing loginlog.tsx component into a comprehensive Audit Log system that tracks ALL system activities. The audit log should capture and display the following detailed information for every action:

**Required Audit Log Details to Track:**

1. **User Authentication Events:**
   - User login (successful/failed)
   - User logout
   - Password change attempts
   - Account lockout events
   - Session expiration

2. **Data Manipulation Events:**
   - Record creation/insert operations
   - Record updates/modifications
   - Record deletions
   - Bulk operations
   - Data export activities

3. **System Administration Events:**
   - User account creation/modification/deletion
   - Role and permission changes
   - System configuration updates
   - Security setting modifications
   - API key management

4. **System-Level Events:**
   - Application startup/shutdown
   - Database connection events
   - Server errors and exceptions
   - Performance warnings
   - Backup/restore operations

5. **Security Events:**
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Security policy violations
   - Audit log access events

**Each audit log entry must include:**
- Timestamp (with timezone)
- User ID/Username
- IP Address
- User Agent/Browser information
- Action type (LOGIN, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
- Module/Feature affected
- Detailed description of the action
- Success/Failure status
- Before and after values (for data changes)
- Session ID
- Request ID (if applicable)
- Severity level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Additional metadata/context

**Display Requirements:**
- Create a searchable, filterable table view
- Implement date range filtering
- Add filters for user, action type, severity, IP address
- Include export functionality (CSV, Excel)
- Add real-time updates capability
- Implement pagination with configurable page size
- Show detailed view/modal for each log entry
- Add visual indicators for different severity levels
- Include summary statistics and charts
- Implement audit trail visualization for specific records

**Technical Implementation:**
- Replace existing login-only tracking with comprehensive event logging
- Ensure all backend operations emit audit events
- Implement proper log retention policies
- Add log archiving capabilities
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
- Optimize for performance with large datasets
- Add proper indexing for fast querying

The audit log should provide a complete trail of all system activities for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.
