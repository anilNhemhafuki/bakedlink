Conduct a full audit of the entire system â€” including frontend, backend, database, APIs, user flows, and third-party integrations â€” to identify and resolve all existing bugs, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and usability issues.

Scope of Review:

Functionality 
Test all core features (e.g., user registration, login, form submissions, order processing, notifications).
Verify data flows correctly between components (e.g., public form â†’ internal order system).
Ensure all buttons, links, forms, and modals work as intended.
User Experience (UX) & UI Consistency 
Check for visual inconsistencies (typography, spacing, alignment, color usage).
Confirm responsive design works across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Fix broken layouts, overlapping elements, or missing content.
Performance 
Identify slow-loading pages, large assets, or inefficient queries.
Optimize front-end and back-end performance (e.g., lazy loading, caching, code splitting).
Security 
Scan for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, insecure authentication).
Ensure form inputs are sanitized and validated.
Confirm secure handling of user data and compliance with privacy standards.
Data Integrity & Logging 
Verify that all user actions (e.g., form submissions, edits, deletions) are logged appropriately.
Ensure no data loss occurs during transfers (e.g., from public form to internal system).
Error Handling 
Improve user-facing error messages (clear, helpful, not technical).
Ensure proper logging of server/client errors for debugging.
Browser & Device Compatibility 
Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and fix rendering issues.
Deliverables:

A detailed report listing all identified issues (categorized by severity: critical, high, medium, low).
Fix all critical and high-priority bugs.
Refactor or remove outdated, redundant, or unused code.
Document any system changes made.
ðŸ”§ Goal: Ensure the system is stable, secure, fast, and user-friendly â€” delivering a seamless and professional experience across all pages and workflows.
