Modify the applicationâ€™s role-based access control (RBAC) system so that users with the superadmin role automatically have full access to all pages, components, APIs, and features without any permission checks.

ðŸ›  Required Changes:
Skip All Permission Checks for Super Admin 
In every useRoleAccess, canAccess(), or route guard function, add a check at the top:
ts
if (user.role === 'superadmin') return true;
This ensures no further permission logic is evaluated for Super Admins.
Update Protected Routes 
Wrap protected routes with logic that skips authorization if user is superadmin.
Example:
tsx
{isSuperAdmin ? <Page /> : <ProtectedRoute resource="settings" action="read"><Page /></ProtectedRoute>}
Show All Navigation Items 
Ensure the sidebar, header menus, and dashboards display all links and modules (e.g., /system-config, /database, /security-logs) when logged in as Super Admin â€” even if hidden from other roles.
Enable Hidden/System Pages 
Confirm that internal tools like:
/system-config
/database
/api-docs
/system-health
/security-logs
/monitoring
/performance
are fully accessible and rendered correctly for Super Admins.
Remove UI-Based Restrictions 
Do not hide buttons, forms, tables, or actions based on permissions if the user is superadmin.
Render all components regardless of granular read/write rules.
Backend Consideration (Optional) 
While frontend should allow full access, ensure backend still validates superadmin identity securely (do not rely solely on frontend logic).
Testing 
Log in as Super Admin and verify:
No 403 or "access denied" messages
All menu items are visible
Every page loads without redirecting to error or login
Admin-only modals, settings, and debug tools are functional
âœ… Deliverables: 

Super Admin can access every route and component without restrictions
No permission popups, redirects, or disabled UI elements
System behaves as "fully unlocked" mode for this role
Other roles continue to respect existing permission rules
